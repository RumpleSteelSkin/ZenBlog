## üìù About The Project

This project is a full-featured Blog Management System (CMS) developed using modern software architectures and design patterns. It is built upon **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and **CQRS** principles. Its goal is to combine a scalable, testable, and maintainable backend infrastructure with a rich user experience provided by a sophisticated frontend application.

## üöÄ Key Features

### General
* **Comprehensive CRUD Operations:** Full management capabilities for Blogs, Categories, Comments, Contact Information, and Social Media Links.
* **JWT-Based Authorization:** Secure access for all sensitive API endpoints using JWT Bearer tokens.
* **Flexible Frontend:** Separate layouts for Admin and Public user interfaces, designed with responsiveness in mind.
* **Enhanced UX:** Utilizes notifications (`Alertify`, `SweetAlert`), animations (`AOS`), and a slider (`Swiper`) for a dynamic user experience.

### Backend (API)
* **CQRS & Mediator:** Separation of concerns for business logic and data retrieval through Commands and Queries using `MediatR`.
* **Fluent Validation:** Robust and clean implementation of business rules for data integrity.
* **Pipeline Behavior:** Centralized validation error handling for all requests.
* **Database:** MSSQL with Entity Framework Core using a Code-First approach.

### Frontend (Angular)
* **Reusability:** Implementation of a `BaseService` to abstract common API interaction logic.
* **Security:** An HTTP Interceptor automatically attaches the JWT token to request headers for authenticated calls.
* **Detailed Error Handling:** Proper and understandable display of API-originated error messages to the user.
